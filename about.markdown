Welcome to my personal site. My name is Parijat Mishra. I currently work at
[Sonar] as Field CTO: talking to our customer and partners on the one hand, and
our engineering, marketing and sales on the other hand, trying to make our
products better and more useful for all.

My prior roles were Head Of Engineering - Infrastructure and Operations at
Hyphen Group (now MoneyHero Group), and Head of Technology, Digital Native
Businesses, ASEAN, at [Amazon Web Services], where I manager a team of stellas
[Solutions Architects].

In and out of work, my two favorite activities are to ask "How can we make this
better?" and "How do we make this problem go away?". I look for answers in
technology. Over the years I have come to realize that the correct application
of technology to solve the right problems, and doing so in a sustainable way, is
more important than the technology itself.

The title of my blog is a whimsical reference to [The Copenhagen Interpretation]
of quantum mechanics. There are a few reasons this term appeals to me:

- "Quantum mechanics is perhaps the most successful theory in the history of
  science... But it is also a theory that challenges our imagination." I find
  that the world of cutting edge technology, such as cloud computing, is
  similar: almost no one disputes that some technologies would be very
  beneficial to their organization and business, but there is a need to explain
  them in terms that people can easily understand--and sometimes those
  explanations are counter-intuitive to people used to the "classical" way of
  doing things.
- There is no definitive historical
  statement of what the Copenhagen Interpretation is. Various people have tried
  to synthesize some principles, attributing them to Niels Bohr and Werner
  Heisenberg. However Bohr and Heisenberg has significant disagreements (as well
  as agreements) in their views. Similarly, there are many technology movements
  that practitioners are trying to define, in an evolving manner.
- While there have been [objections] to some of
  the Copenhagen Interpretation's principles, it is the most widely accepted
  label that physicists give to their own views. Similarly, technology
  "paradigms" like cloud computing, micro-services, serverless computing etc.
  have different definitions and principles, with most people largely agreeing
  on a core set of beliefs, but disagreeing about some of them.
