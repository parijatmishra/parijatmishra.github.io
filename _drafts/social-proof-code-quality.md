title: Improve Code Quality Using Social Proof
---

# Random thoughts

**Goal**: I want to demonstrate that using SQ EE portfolios is the best way to increase
code quality in an enterprise.

**Takeaway**: The portfolios feature of SQEE / SCE is the best way to get teams to benchmark against each other.

**Why**: Sets social norms. You improve one/two teams, rest will follow.

**Audience**: those with SQ CE/DE licenses and reluctant to buy SQ EE.

**Story**: Improving code quality across an org is not simple because:
- Telling devs to improve code quality doesn't work
    - Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do

- Showing a dev/team their code quality doesn't work
    - There's always a tradeoff between speed and quality
    - We tried our best and our score is X.
    - What is "good"? Whatever manager says?
- Portfolios:
    - Compare across teams and over time
    - Both managers and teams have same view
    - Teams can compare with each other
        - Teams can bitch about each other -- "that team had it too easy/are different"
    - You can motivate teams to learn from each other
- How to get started: get one team onboard; show their work

**Anecdotes**:
- Advise *and* help: every internal doc page in AWS had a feedback link while in JP they didn't
- *Learned helplessness* - when people don't know how to debate/ask advice <-- forcing SQ reports on devs/teams; not giving them SonarLint
- Getting-started: get one team onboard, show their work -- my trip to Phuket with a friend, low season, empty restaurants, when we entered, a lot of others did too
